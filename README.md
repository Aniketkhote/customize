Thanks to the introduction of [extension methods](https://dart.dev/guides/language/extension-methods) in Dart 2.7.0, `customize` makes it possible to build widget tree\`s more readable and efficient.

`customize` is build as a tool to enhance your Flutter UI development experience and make code easier. It is highly inspired by Bootstrap and Tailwind CSS.
